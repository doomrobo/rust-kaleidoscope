# Rust Kaleidoscope

My own implementation of the
[LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/).
This has been done and well-documented in
[iron-kaldeidoscope](https://github.com/jauhien/iron-kaleidoscope)
but I wanted to do the excercises myself. There are also slight deviations from
the original content.
